# Unauthorized Access to Metadata and User Data like CTF

![Unauthorized Access to Metadata and User Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lu3ky13/Unauthorized-Access-to-Metadata-and-User-Data-like-CTF/refs/heads/main/35345345.PNG)

## Overview

In many Bug Bounty and Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, you may encounter AWS or similar cloud environments where accessing sensitive metadata and user data is restricted. Often, these challenges require creative solutions to bypass access controls.

This repository provides two scripts that can be used to extract sensitive data from these environments, helping you gain access to crucial information. These tools have been successfully used in both Bug Bounty hunting and CTF challenges, assisting in the identification and exploitation of security flaws.

## Features

- **Metadata Extraction:** Gain access to restricted metadata.
- **User Data Extraction:** Retrieve user-specific data from environments like AWS.
- **Bug Bounty and CTF Ready:** Tailored to meet the needs of security researchers and CTF participants.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lu3ky13/Unauthorized-Access-to-Metadata-and-User-Data-like-CTF.git
